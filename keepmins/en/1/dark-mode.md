# Dark Mode

![](..\assets\darkmode.gif)

Color scheme is following your system settings.

When the system color preference is set to “dark”, website color will automatically switch to dark mode, no refresh is needed.

Part of the systems and browsers are currently supported, older systems and browsers with no color options are not supported.

### Supporting list

- Windows 10: Firefox 67/ Chrome 76
- MacOS Mojave: Safari12.1 / Firefox 67 /Chrome 76
- iOS 13/iPadOS 13: Safari on iOS
- Android: Android webView76 / Chrome76 for Android/ Firefox67 for Android

Unfortunately, Windows 7 and 8, as well as the OS before MoOS Mojave, are completely unsupported because there is no concept of “system color mode”.

IE, Edge, and Opear are also not work with dark mode.
