# Upgrading V2.7 to V2.9

Since there is a huge difference between V2.7 and V2.9, upgrading from V2.7 to V2.9 requires special attention.

## Step by Step

The upgrade will cause the website to not work properly for a short time, so it is recommended to do it when the traffic is low, such as at night.

- (Optional) Back up the Keep Minutes 2.7 theme file, the plugins;
- (Optional) back up the database;
- **Activate a default WordPress theme, such as Twenty Nineteen, any one is okay;**
- Remove (delete) old themes on server (including desktop and mobile themes and previous P2 themes);
- Temporarily disable all plugins.

Follow the instructions in the [2.2 Installing themes](https://doc.dukeyin.com/keepmins/en/install/) in this document to install the new theme.
