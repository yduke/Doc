# Why This



Keep Minutes is a microblogging WordPress theme, all your daily creation is on the front end and no need to go WordPress Back end at all!

## Why did I create this theme?

I was a student back then, now I am an architect designer.

Around 2012, Twitter couldn’t normally be accessed in china because of government censorship. At that time, I just started to learn how to blog with and customize WordPress. Because of the similar experience of Blogspot and WordPress.com, I decided to make something on my own, something just like Twitter because I firmly believe that:

> The content stored in the provider’s server always implies a huge risk. Only when you control the data, maintains long-term stability.

So, completely in personal interest, the first version of the “Keep Minutes” WordPress theme was released.

## Milestone

1. August 13, 2012, Inspired by the WordPress P2 theme, and goes as a child theme of P2.
2. June 23, 2019, Keep Minutes is an independent theme not relying on any of the other themes ~~and plugins~~.

## Present
