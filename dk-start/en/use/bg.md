# Customized Background

In the backend "Settings" -> "DK Start Options" -> "General".

You can set the background color of the page.

There are two color options, corresponding to the color at the top and bottom of the page, and the two colors will be rendered in a gradient.

If you want to use a single color, just set the two colors to the same.
